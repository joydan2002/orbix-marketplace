# DATABASECONFIG CLASS REDECLARATION FIX

## Problem
```
Fatal error: Cannot declare class DatabaseConfig, because the name is already in use in /app/config/database.php on line 19
```

This error occurred because the `DatabaseConfig` class was being included multiple times through different require statements.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Files Including database.php:
1. **profile.php** → `require_once 'config/database.php'`
2. **header.php** → `require_once __DIR__ . '/../config/database.php'`
3. **seller-channel.php** → **TWO TIMES** (lines 18 & 490)

### Execution Flow:
```
profile.php 
    ↓ includes database.php (DatabaseConfig declared)
    ↓ includes header.php
        ↓ includes database.php AGAIN (DatabaseConfig redeclaration ERROR!)
```

## Solutions Applied

### 1. **Protected Class Declaration**
Added class existence check in `database.php`:
```php
if (!class_exists('DatabaseConfig')) {
    class DatabaseConfig {
        // ... class content
    }
}
```

### 2. **Removed Duplicate Includes**
Commented out the second database.php include in `seller-channel.php`:
```php
// try {
//     require_once '../config/database.php';
// } catch (Exception $e) {
//     die("Database connection failed: " . $e->getMessage());
// }
```

### 3. **Protected Header Includes**
Added conditional include in both header.php files:
```php
// Include database config only if DatabaseConfig class doesn't exist yet
if (!class_exists('DatabaseConfig')) {
    require_once __DIR__ . '/../config/database.php';
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/public/config/database.php`**
   - Added `if (!class_exists('DatabaseConfig'))` protection
   - Fixed syntax with proper class closing bracket

2. **`/public/seller-channel.php`**
   - Commented out duplicate database.php include

3. **`/includes/header.php`**
   - Added conditional include protection

4. **`/public/includes/header.php`**
   - Added conditional include protection

## Technical Benefits

✅ **Prevents class redeclaration errors**  
✅ **Maintains backward compatibility**  
✅ **Allows flexible include order**  
✅ **No performance impact** (class_exists is fast)  
✅ **Future-proof** for additional includes  

## Result

**Profile.php and all other pages should now load without DatabaseConfig errors!**

**Deployment:** Successfully pushed to Railway (commit `4aea8d8`)

## Prevention Strategy

The `class_exists()` checks ensure that:
- Multiple files can safely include database.php
- Include order doesn't matter
- New files won't cause redeclaration issues
- Development and production environments work consistently
